This is Vacation Managment Project. 
What you need is : -visual studio 2019 or higher
                   -MSSQL (prefer 2018)
When you open visual studio you need to open PM(package manager) and write Update-Database so database can be created.
After that you are ready to go.
Initial admin will be created if database is empty
Username = "Admin"
Password = "admin"
With that admin you can create employees or new admins. When you create new user make sure to put valid email adress bcs application will send 
mails when user add vacation reqests or when admin approved/declines that request.
Explore and have fun. For any questions feel free to write me.
